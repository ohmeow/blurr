      <td>raising victor vargas : a review &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; you know, raising victor vargas is like sticking your hands into a big, steaming bowl of oatmeal. it's warm and gooey, but you're not sure if it feels right. try as i might, no matter how warm and gooey raising victor vargas became i was always aware that something didn't quite feel right. victor vargas suffers from a certain overconfidence on the director's part. apparently, the director thought that the ethnic backdrop of a latino family on the lower east side, and an idyllic storyline would make the film critic proof. he was right, but it didn't fool me. raising victor vargas is the story about a seventeen - year old boy called, you guessed it, victor vargas ( victor rasuk ) who lives his teenage years chasing more skirt than the rolling stones could do in all the years they've toured. the movie starts off in ` ugly fat'donna's bedroom where victor is sure to seduce her, but a cry from outside disrupts his plans when his best - friend harold ( kevin rivera ) comes - a - looking for him. caught in the attempt by harold and his sister, victor vargas runs off for damage control. yet even with the embarrassing implication that he's been boffing the homeliest girl in the neighborhood, nothing dissuades young victor from going off on the hunt for more fresh meat. on a hot, new york city day they make way to the local public swimming pool where victor's eyes catch a glimpse of the lovely young nymph judy ( judy marte ), who's not just pretty, but a strong and independent too. the relationship that develops between victor and judy becomes the focus of the film. the story also focuses on victor's family that is comprised of his grandmother or abuelita ( altagracia guzman ), his brother nino ( also played by real life brother to victor, silvestre rasuk ) and his sister vicky ( krystal rodriguez ). the action follows victor between scenes with judy and scenes with his family. victor tries to cope with being an oversexed pimp - daddy, his feelings for judy and his grandmother's conservative catholic upbringing. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; the problems that arise from raising victor vargas are a few, but glaring errors. throughout the film you get to know certain characters like vicky, nino, grandma, judy and even</td>

      <td>well, what can i say. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; " what the bleep do we know " has achieved the nearly impossible - leaving behind such masterpieces of the genre as " the postman ", " the dungeon master ", " merlin ", and so fourth, it will go down in history as the single worst movie i have ever seen in its entirety. and that, ladies and gentlemen, is impressive indeed, for i have seen many a bad movie. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; this masterpiece of modern cinema consists of two interwoven parts, alternating between a silly and contrived plot about an extremely annoying photographer, abandoned by her husband and forced to take anti - depressants to survive, and a bunch of talking heads going on about how quantum physics supposedly justifies their new - agy pseudo - philosophy. basically, if you start your day off meditating to the likes of enya and kenny g, this movie is for you. if you have a sense of humor, a crowd of people who know how to have fun, and a sizable portion of good weed, then this movie is for you as well. otherwise, stay away. take my word for it. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; the first thing that struck me about " what the bleep do you know " is that is seemed to be edited and put together by the same kinds of people that shoot cheap weddings on camera, complete with pink heart effects, computer - generated sparkles across the screen, and other assorted silliness. who let these people anywhere near a theatrical release is a mystery to me. i guess this is what too much kenny g does to you. the movie was permeated with cheesy gci, the likes that you or i can produce on our own computer via over - the - counter video editing software, but never would, because it's just way too ridiculous. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; the script was _ obviously _ written by someone with no writing experience whatsoever. not only were all the characters and conversations cumbersome and contrived beyond belief, but the " writers " felt like they had to shove every relevant piece of information, or rather disinformation, which is what most of this movie was all about, all the way down your throat. well, given the target audience, that may not have been too bad of an idea. the main character, for example, spends half the movie popping pills.</td>

( and not even then ) but, there were things in this movie that were never by any means ever mentioned or even hinted at, in the movie. reminded me of the way they decided to kill off the black man in the original movie version of the shining. i didn't like that, either. what the movie's press release should have said is... " we got the basic, very basic, idea from shirley jackson's book, we kept the same names of the house and several ( though not all ) of the leading character's names, but then we decided to write our own story, and, what the heck, we watched the changeling and the shining and ghost first, and decided to throw in a bit of them, too. " &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; 2. they completely lost the theme of a parapyschologist inviting carefully picked guest who had all had brushes with the paranormal in their pasts, to investigate a house that truly seemed to have been " born bad ". no, instead, this " doctor " got everyone to the house under the false pretense of studying their " insomnia " ( he really invited them there to scare them to death and then see how they reacted to their fear... like lab rats, who he mentioned never got told they are part of an experiment... nice guy ). this doctor, who did not have the same name, by the way, was as different from the</td>

<h2 id="&#10071;-Updates">&#10071; Updates<a class="anchor-link" href="#&#10071;-Updates"> </a></h2><p><strong>06/27/2020</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Simplified the <a href="/blurr/utils#BLURR_MODEL_HELPER.get_hf_objects"><code>BLURR_MODEL_HELPER.get_hf_objects</code></a> method to support a wide range of options in terms of building the necessary huggingface objects (architecture, config, tokenizer, and model).  Also added <code>cache_dir</code> for saving pre-trained objects in a custom directory.</li>
<li>Misc. renaming and cleanup that may break existing code (please see the docs/source if things blow up)</li>
<li>Added missing required libraries to requirements.txt (e.g., nlp)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>05/23/2020</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Initial support for text generation (e.g., summarization, conversational agents) models now included. Only tested with BART so if you try it with other models before I do, lmk what works ... and what doesn't</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>05/17/2020</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Major code restructuring to make it easier to build out the library.</li>
<li><a href="/blurr/data-core#HF_TokenizerTransform"><code>HF_TokenizerTransform</code></a> replaces <code>HF_Tokenizer</code>, handling the tokenization and numericalization in one place.  DataBlock code has been dramatically simplified.</li>
<li>Tokenization correctly handles huggingface tokenizers that require <code>add_prefix_space=True</code>.</li>
<li><a href="/blurr/modeling-core#HF_BaseModelCallback"><code>HF_BaseModelCallback</code></a> and <a href="/blurr/modeling-core#HF_BaseModelCallback"><code>HF_BaseModelCallback</code></a> are required and work together in order to allow developers to tie into any callback friendly event exposed by fastai2 and also pass in named arguments to the huggingface models.</li>
<li><code>show_batch</code> and <code>show_results</code> have been updated for Question/Answer and Token Classification models to represent the data and results in a more easily intepretable manner than the defaults.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>05/06/2020</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Initial support for Token classification (e.g., NER) models now included</li>
<li>Extended fastai's <code>Learner</code> object with a <code>predict_tokens</code> method used specifically in token classification</li>
<li><a href="/blurr/modeling-core#HF_BaseModelCallback"><code>HF_BaseModelCallback</code></a> can be used (or extended) instead of the model wrapper to ensure your inputs into the huggingface model is correct (recommended). See docs for examples (and thanks to fastai's Sylvain for the suggestion!)</li>
<li><code>HF_Tokenizer</code> can work with strings or a string representation of a list (the later helpful for token classification tasks)</li>
<li><code>show_batch</code> and <code>show_results</code> methods have been updated to allow better control on how huggingface tokenized data is represented in those methods</li>
</ul>
