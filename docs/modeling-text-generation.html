Floods can be destructive; however, they can also bring blessings, as the annual floods of the Nile did for ancient Egypt. The world's great universities can be crucial instruments in shaping, in a positive way, humankind's reaction to globalization and the development of humankind itself.

      <td>(CNN) -- A suspect is in custody about an hour after one person was shot late Monday morning on the campus of Middle Tennessee State University, a school spokesman said. Officials called off a lockdown, which had been in effect as SWAT teams and other law enforcement authorities converged on the campus, after the suspect was detained about 12:45 p.m., said the university's media relations director, Tom Tozer. A gun said to have been used in the incident has also been confiscated. Authorities were alerted at 11:51 a.m. about a shooting in a basic and applied science building located in a cluster of university structures. "From what I understand, there were two men who got into an argument over by some of our buildings," Tozer said. "One shot the other in the hand, then took off." The victim, whose condition was not immediately known, was taken to a nearby medical facility. Tozer said he cannot confirm whether those involved were students. Meanwhile, police began hunting for the shooter on 25,000-student university's campus, in the central Tennessee city of Murfreesboro. Firearms are not allowed on campus, per school policy, according to Tozer. The spokesman said that officials believe the situation is now under control. "We are advising people to proceed with caution with normal activities today," Tozer said.</td>

      <td>(CNN) -- "Black Dynamite" has a new lease on life. This time around, the hero of the 2009 film that lampooned blaxploitation movies is in animated form in a new series on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim program block. Some of the actors from the film will reprise their roles, but there will be changes as well. The movie, which enjoyed only a two-week theatrical release despite premiering at the Sundance Film Festival, was deliberately cheesy. To parody the cheap, hastily produced blaxploitation films, "Black Dynamite" actors intentionally chewed up scenery or performed awkwardly. There were telltale signs of a second-rate production, such as the appearance of a boom mike. The new "Black Dynamite" is still set in the 1970s, but the 10-episode cartoon series is more like "Shaft" than a sendup of blaxpoitation, said Michael Jai White, who supplies Black Dynamite's voice and serves as a producer. As in the film, the polyester pants suit-garbed Black Dynamite is a former CIA agent, a lover and a kung fu fighter. He has returned to the 'hood to combat evil and protect the children in the Whorephanage, who are looked after by the working girls and their boss, sexy no-nonsense Honey Bee (Kym Whitley). "The characters have to be a little bigger than life, but it's a fun challenge, and the essence of the characters is still there," said Carl Jones, former executive producer of "The Boondocks" on Adult Swim, who serves as the director and an executive producer for "Black Dynamite." "Obviously, with a cartoon, you can do more things than you can do in live action," Jones said. "It opens a lot more doors for us to explore different characters and genres." In one episode, Black Dynamite is hired to make sure comedian Richard Pryor shows up for a scheduled performance. In the story, Pryor is distraught because audiences automatically laugh at him, making it hard to offer serious social commentary. "I wanted to take another perspective on Richard as a human being," Jones said. "Richard never wanted to be funny. He had something to say. He was a storyteller. He was a teacher to me." In another episode, a parody of "King Kong," Black Dynamite goes after an albino ape that scaled the iconic Watts Towers in Los Angeles. White said</td>

      <td>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN) -- Former presidents of Mexico, Colombia and Brazil called Wednesday for the decriminalization of marijuana for personal use and a change in tactics on the war on drugs, a Spanish news agency said. People march in support of legalized marijuana in late January in Belem, northern Brazil. Ex-presidents Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico, Cesar Gaviria of Colombia and Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil made their announcement at a meeting in Brazil of the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy, the EFE news agency said. "The problem is that current policies are based on prejudices and fears and not on results," Gaviria said at a news conference in which the commission's recommendations were presented. The 17-member panel worked on the report for a year and will forward it to all Latin American governments as well as the United States and the European Union, EFE said. Gaviria said the time is right to start a debate on the subject, particularly with the pragmatic openings provided by the election of President Barack Obama in the United States. "In many states in the United States, as is the case in California, they have begun to change federal policies with regard to tolerating marijuana for therapeutic purposes. And in Washington there's some consensus that the current policy is failing," EFE quotes Gaviria as saying. Decriminalization should be accompanied by treatment for addicts and public service campaigns on abuse prevention, the commission said. "If you don't help those who are dependent, you are half way there because they are going to commit crime to get money and pay for the drug," Gaviria said. Cardoso said the group called for only the decriminalization of marijuana and not other illicit drugs because "you have to start somewhere" and it would have been unrealistic to ask the same for all drugs, EFE said. Marijuana was chosen because it is grown in all countries in the region and because it is "less harmful." The decades-old criminalization of personal consumption has failed to stop the plant's cultivation and distribution, the group said. The commission urged that all current criminal prosecution be aimed at drug cartels and organized crime and not marijuana smokers, EFE said. Zedillo did not attend the news conference but worked on the report, Cardoso said. Wednesday's recommendation was the second time in less than a week that a Latin American government official called for decriminalization. A mayor in Peru suggested Friday that the federal government legalize illicit drugs and</td>

      <td>(CNN) -- Everyone knows the beach is the thing in Miami, and specifically South Beach, where all the beautiful people go to see and be seen. But what if you're traveling with children or grandparents or people who don't want to be covered in suntan lotion and little else all day? We asked for your recommendations beyond the beach, where you go when you're not lying on a towel. "There are so many Miamis to visit when you are here," one iReporter said. Here are a few of our iReporters' favorites. The art scene. Miami's vibrant art scene is very much in evidence in Wynwood, where the local arts association has a map to keep track of which artists are in the hood. "If you are lucky enough to be visiting on the second Saturday of the month, you better make your way over to Wynwood for the local art walk," writes iReporter Jennifer Ortiz, a Miami native. "Live music and DJs spin in various galleries throughout the night, often with free beer and other refreshments. Here you'll witness some of the world's finest urban art; muralists and graffiti artists have been brought in from around the globe to use Wynwood as their canvas." You can also use the map to tour galleries during the day. For a Cuban feel, Oritz recommends heading to Little Havana's "Viernes Culturales" on the last Friday of each month. If you prefer the expert's tour of Little Havana or other parts of Miami, contact HistoryMiami for an organized or private tour. iReport: Share your Santa Fe tips and photos. Have a cafe con leche and more. Miami's dynamic food scene now goes beyond everyday Cuban cuisine to fine and experimental dining with local ingredients. "Hang with the locals at eclectic places like The Electric Pickle, Bardot or The Stage in the Midtown/Design District," writes iReporter Alain Lantigua, who has lived in the Miami area for most of his life. Other iReporters recommend Sugarcane Raw Bar Grill, in the Arts District, and Sra. Martinez, "Top Chef" judge Michelle Bernstein's tapas restaurant. Many little Cuban joints will feed you a good cheap lunch, iReporters tell us, and you can get an excellent Cuban coffee after your meal for half the price of a Starbuck's. For affordable classic Cuban food, go to South Miami and "hit Lario's on a Saturday night for live Cuban music,"</td>

<span class="s2">About 10 men armed with pistols and small machine guns raided a casino in Switzerland and made off </span>
<span class="s2">into France with several hundred thousand Swiss francs in the early hours of Sunday morning, police said. </span>
<span class="s2">The men, dressed in black clothes and black ski masks, split into two groups during the raid on the Grand Casino </span>
<span class="s2">Basel, Chief Inspector Peter Gill told CNN. One group tried to break into the casino&#39;s vault on the lower level </span>
<span class="s2">but could not get in, but they did rob the cashier of the money that was not secured, he said. The second group </span>
<span class="s2">of armed robbers entered the upper level where the roulette and blackjack tables are located and robbed the </span>
<span class="s2">cashier there, he said. As the thieves were leaving the casino, a woman driving by and unaware of what was </span>
<span class="s2">occurring unknowingly blocked the armed robbers&#39; vehicles. A gunman pulled the woman from her vehicle, beat </span>
<span class="s2">her, and took off for the French border. The other gunmen followed into France, which is only about 100 </span>
<span class="s2">meters (yards) from the casino, Gill said. There were about 600 people in the casino at the time of the robbery. </span>
<span class="s2">There were no serious injuries, although one guest on the Casino floor was kicked in the head by one of the </span>
<span class="s2">robbers when he moved, the police officer said. Swiss authorities are working closely with French authorities, </span>
<span class="s2">Gill said. The robbers spoke French and drove vehicles with French license plates. CNN&#39;s Andreena Narayan </span>
