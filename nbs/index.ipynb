    "> A library that integrates huggingface transformers with version 2 of the fastai framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Named after the **fast**est **transformer** (well, at least of the Autobots), ***blurr*** provides both a comprehensive and extensible framework for training and deploying *all* 🤗 [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) transformer models with [fastai](http://docs.fast.ai/) v2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing features like fastai's new `@typedispatch` and `@patch` decorators, and a simple class hiearchy, **blurr** provides fastai developers with the ability to train and deploy transformers for sequence classification, question answer, token classification, summarization, and language modeling tasks. Though much of this works out-of-the-box, users will be able to customize the tokenization strategies and model inputs based on task and/or architecture as needed.\n",

    "\n",
    "**08/20/2020** \n",
    "* Updated everything to work latest version of fastai (tested against 2.0.0)\n",
    "* Added batch-time padding, so that by default now, `HF_TokenizerTransform` doesn't add any padding tokens and all huggingface inputs are padded simply to the max sequence length in each batch rather than to the max length (passed in and/or acceptable to the model).  This should create efficiencies across the board, from memory consumption to GPU utilization.  The old tried and true method of padding during tokenization requires you to pass in `padding='max_length` to `HF_TextBlock`.\n",
    "* Removed code to remove fastai2 @patched summary methods which had previously conflicted with a couple of the huggingface transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "**08/13/2020** \n",
    "* Updated everything to work latest transformers and fastai\n",
    "* Reorganized code to bring it more inline with how huggingface separates out their \"tasks\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**07/06/2020** \n",
    "* Updated everything to work huggingface>=3.02\n",
    "* Changed a lot of the internals to make everything more efficient and performant along with the latest version of huggingface ... meaning, I have broken things for folks using previous versions of blurr :).\n",
    "\n",
    "**06/27/2020** \n",
    "* Simplified the `BLURR_MODEL_HELPER.get_hf_objects` method to support a wide range of options in terms of building the necessary huggingface objects (architecture, config, tokenizer, and model).  Also added `cache_dir` for saving pre-trained objects in a custom directory.\n",
    "* Misc. renaming and cleanup that may break existing code (please see the docs/source if things blow up)\n",
    "* Added missing required libraries to requirements.txt (e.g., nlp)\n",
    "\n",
    "**05/23/2020** \n",
    "* Initial support for text generation (e.g., summarization, conversational agents) models now included. Only tested with BART so if you try it with other models before I do, lmk what works ... and what doesn't\n",
    "\n",
    "**05/17/2020** \n",
    "* Major code restructuring to make it easier to build out the library.\n",
    "* `HF_TokenizerTransform` replaces `HF_Tokenizer`, handling the tokenization and numericalization in one place.  DataBlock code has been dramatically simplified.\n",
    "* Tokenization correctly handles huggingface tokenizers that require `add_prefix_space=True`.\n",
    "* `HF_BaseModelCallback` and `HF_BaseModelCallback` are required and work together in order to allow developers to tie into any callback friendly event exposed by fastai2 and also pass in named arguments to the huggingface models.\n",
    "* `show_batch` and `show_results` have been updated for Question/Answer and Token Classification models to represent the data and results in a more easily intepretable manner than the defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "**05/06/2020** \n",
    "* Initial support for Token classification (e.g., NER) models now included\n",
    "* Extended fastai's `Learner` object with a `predict_tokens` method used specifically in token classification\n",
    "* `HF_BaseModelCallback` can be used (or extended) instead of the model wrapper to ensure your inputs into the huggingface model is correct (recommended). See docs for examples (and thanks to fastai's Sylvain for the suggestion!)\n",
    "* `HF_Tokenizer` can work with strings or a string representation of a list (the later helpful for token classification tasks)\n",
    "* `show_batch` and `show_results` methods have been updated to allow better control on how huggingface tokenized data is represented in those methods"
