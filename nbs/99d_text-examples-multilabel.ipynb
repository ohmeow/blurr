       "      <td>Richard Ellmyer - I think most sane, patriotic Americans hear and agree with your total exasperation at this lawless, ridiculous situation.  However, while I agree I am very disturbed at the approach by the FBI SACs in Nevada and Portland, I think you are missing who is responsible here.  On January 4, the White House made a public announcement that this terrorist takeover of U.S. Federal Government land and buildings was \"ultimately a local law enforcement matter.\"  Then after that, \"Obama administration leaders\" told Reuters that the Obama administration had \"ordered\" federal law enforcement not to have a \"conflict\" with these Sovereign Citizen terrorists in Oregon. So while there is plenty of blame to go around, I think the focus needs to be on the person who is actually making the REAL decisions here, and it is not ultimately FBI Portland SAC.  I urge Oregonians to contact the White House and also presidential candidates and DEMAND a restoral of the rule of law to this anarchic situation.  More children, more citizens are put at risk, and history has shown the failure to act in Nevada in 2014 ultimately cost the lives of other Americans in Las Vegas down the road from such terrorist supporters.  It is time our leadership spends time doing THEIR JOB, not playing political games with media.</td>\n",

They both do work for the companies they serve.  You're just trying to justify his actions because he's your buddy and we seem to be picking on him.  LOL!  It's still disingenuous and an abuse of vacation time to regularly take vacation at around the same time of the month or quarter from his job as Mayor that Caldwell himself declares that he's doing 24/7 on numerous occasions because he loves the job.  IF he loves the job as Mayor so much, why does he need to do other work as an Independent Contractor during time that he would normally spend being the Mayor?  Bottom line is Caldwell needs to be replaced as Mayor because the public can't trust what he says.  I remember he told the legislature that if they extended the GET 5 years, he would have enough funds to finish rail.  Wrong!  LOL!!</td>\n",
