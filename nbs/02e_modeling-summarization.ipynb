The first \"Stoke Mandeville Games\" were organized in 1948 to coincide with the London Olympics, the second to be held in Britain.

Many were military veterans injured on the battlefields of World War II. Just a year later, six teams competed at Stoke Mandeville -- with wheelchair netball, a forerunner of wheelchair basketball, being introduced -- as sport became a central part of a rehabilitation process that had been revolutionized by Guttmann. In 1956, a \"statement of intent\" was unveiled for the Games, which were by this time international, according to to the Mandeville Legacy website run by the local authority.
