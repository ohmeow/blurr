The list represents a group of 17 countries that harbor the majority of the Earth's species and are therefore considered extremely biodiverse.

As authorities piece together Ciancia's actions leading up to the shooting, new details emerged Sunday from those close to the suspect. According to someone who knew Ciancia and his roommates well, Ciancia began asking one of his three roommates days before the shooting if he could get a ride to the airport. Ciancia told the roommate that his father, back in New Jersey, was sick and he needed to get home \"to go help take care of him,\" the source said. Ciancia didn't, however, indicate what day he needed to leave.
