The list represents a group of 17 countries that harbor the majority of the Earth's species and are therefore considered extremely biodiverse.

Some 574 out of 717 reptile species found in Mexico -- the most in any country -- can only be encountered within its borders.

Both Zimmerman's and Martin's mothers expressed no hesitation Friday in separate court appearances as to whose panicked voice is heard screaming during a 911 call from that February 26, 2012, night in Sanford, Florida: Each said it was her son. That contradiction -- with Sybrina Fulton insisting it was her son, Trayvon, who cried out, while Gladys Zimmerman said it was her son, George, who was yelling after being attacked by the teen -- was central to Friday's court proceedings, and central to the second-degree murder case unfolding in central Florida. Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty and claimed he shot the teenager in self-defense. The 911 call played twice in court on Friday, his lawyers claim, back up their assertion that it was Martin, and not their client, who was the aggressor. Testifying late Friday afternoon, Gladys Zimmerman said she was sure George was the one yelling. Why? \"Because he's my son.\" She answered \"all of the above\" when asked whether she had ever before heard her George Zimmerman laugh loudly or cry out for help.</td>\n",
