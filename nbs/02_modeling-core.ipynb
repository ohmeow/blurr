Merry mayhem is what would happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The explosion of a wartime bomb leads to the discovery of ancient documents which show that Pimlico was ceded to the Duchy of Burgundy centuries ago, a small historical footnote long since forgotten. To the new Burgundians, however, this is an unexpected opportunity to live as they please, free from any interference from Whitehall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stanley Holloway is excellent as the minor city politician who suddenly finds himself leading one of the world's tiniest nations. Dame Margaret Rutherford is a delight as the history professor who sides with Pimlico. Others in the stand-out cast include Hermione Baddeley, Paul Duplis, Naughton Wayne, Basil Radford &amp; Sir Michael Hordern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Burgundy!</td>\n",

By the time it was revealed to the viewer it was just a case of 'big deal, tell me something I don't know.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this to be pointless movie that may have challenged the genre conventions, unfortunately those conventions are that horror films are tense and packed with genuine sense of horror.

Merry mayhem is what would happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The explosion of a wartime bomb leads to the discovery of ancient documents which show that Pimlico was ceded to the Duchy of Burgundy centuries ago, a small historical footnote long since forgotten. To the new Burgundians, however, this is an unexpected opportunity to live as they please, free from any interference from Whitehall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stanley Holloway is excellent as the minor city politician who suddenly finds himself leading one of the world's tiniest nations. Dame Margaret Rutherford is a delight as the history professor who sides with Pimlico. Others in the stand-out cast include Hermione Baddeley, Paul Duplis, Naughton Wayne, Basil Radford &amp; Sir Michael Hordern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Burgundy!</td>\n",

Tiffany-Amber Thiessen of \"Saved by the Bell\" fame, makes an appearance in the film and looks incredible. finally Billy Dee Williams, reliving his Colt 45 days, gives the movie a touch of class. and for those out there who are mindless movie quoters like myself, you will find this movie to be eminently quotable, \"ooh, it's a lady!\"</td>\n",

To the greater point about Bernie, and socialism in general, is that it's complicated. Socialism isn't a universal failure. There are European countries where it has worked, and there are asian countries (such as china) where it has, largely, worked. The answer isn't a blanket statement of \"does socialism work or not,\" but rather one about what is the proper role of government. Unfettered capitalism has largely proven to be ineffective in a number of areas, so we as a society have decided to regulate it. I'm about as much of a capitalist as you'll find, but I think we can all point out shortcomings with the current system. Moving the top tax rate from 40% to 50% isn't the same thing as being \"Socialist\" and we are being intellectually dishonest when we portray it as such.</td>\n",
